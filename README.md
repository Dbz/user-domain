Chrome Extension for Immediately


Create a Chrome extension for Gmail that adds a link next to the sender name in each inbox line item.  This link should point to the domain of that sender's email address.  So for example, when viewing this email in the inbox, the extension would add a link to http://immediatelyapp.com next to my name.  The extension should attempt to fetch a favicon or other similar asset from that website, and insert this to the left of the user's name in the line items.  Ignore @gmail.com addresses.
